  "body": "### Why PeerSign?\r\nCode signing has become a crowned jewel of the software engineering industry, allowing organizations to securely guarantee that they are the sole originators of their software and subsequent updates to this software, and that their source code has not been tampered with by some malicious third party or government. The ongoing Apple vs FBI court case has demonstrated to the world that governments (particularly the U.S. government) do not respect the security or sanctity of software code signing, and in fact wish to circumvent this security by compelling companies, such as Apple, to create back-doors that would allow government agencies to push malicious updates that masquerade as genuine, leaving organizations and their users not only vulnerable to the whims of government agencies, but indeed, to any malicious third party that manages to exploit these back-doors.\r\n\r\nIf code-signing were instead done in a decentralized or distributed fashion whereby trusted users or organizations residing in a variety of countries and legal jurisdictions must sign off on the contents of each software update, it would be impossible for a single government or foreign entity to legally compel a company to push a malicious update or create a backdoor, since users outside this government's jurisdiction could object to such updates, breaking the chain.\r\n\r\nWith this in mind, PeerSign aims to accomplish the following:\r\n* Provide simple, open-source software protected by the GNU General Public License for coordinating decentralized code signing for an entire product or organization\r\n* Allow organizations to implement decentralized code-signing alongside existing code-signing solutions, without the need to create or use additional Certificate Authorities and without any OS-specific compatibility issues\r\n* Let organizations elect trusted users from different legal jurisdictions (these can be individuals, companies, or even privacy organizations such as the EFF) who are part of the Signing Chain for a particular product. The organization will not be able to push an update to their software without every trusted user in the chain reviewing and approving the update. If a code signer rejects an update, he/she must provide a reason why this update violates whatever privacy or security guarantees the company in question wishes to make to its users.\r\n* Enable organizations to use decentralized code-signing without having to release their source code to the general public. Under the PeerSign system, it will be possible to set up organizations where code changes are only shared with trusted users, though obviously users will have the greatest trust in organizations who disclose full source code to the general public.\r\n* Provide an open marketplace and escrow service where organizations can securely compensate trusted users for their code-signing/review services. To ensure users have trust in this system, code signers must be compensated the same amount of money regardless of whether they approve or deny an update. We may implement this using a Blockchain, where a \"transaction\" is carried out by trusted users from numerous locations reviewing code changes.",
