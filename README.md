# PeerSign
The world's first open-source decentralized/distributed code-signing authority. Create trust in your organization's software updates by establishing trust nodes with signing authority in multiple countries!

## Work in Progress

This is an early-stage work in progress as the technology involved is still being actively researched. At this point no code is available, however a draft proof-of-concept paper has been attached
outlining the underlying technology needed to fully realize decentralized code-signing.

## Future Work

1. finalize and publish research paper
2. use blockchain technology in some way?
3. open-source cross-platform client for signing code
4. centralized (non-profit?) repository for storing code attestations
5. recognition in Microsoft Screen Filter, etc?
6. operate a real-life CA backed by peer sign technology
